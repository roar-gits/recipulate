# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs document significant technical decisions for future reference.

## Format

Each ADR uses this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: Why was a decision needed?
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Consequences**: What are the tradeoffs?

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Choosing between frameworks, libraries, or architectures
- Making a decision that would be hard to reverse
- Future you (or Claude) might ask "why did we do it this way?"

## Decisions

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| _(none yet)_ | | |

## Template

Create new ADRs as `NNNN-short-title.md`:

```markdown
