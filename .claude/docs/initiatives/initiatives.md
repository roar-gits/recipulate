# Initiatives

Time-bound work streams. Unlike permanent reference docs, these track active projects.

## Active

| Initiative | File | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| _(none yet)_ | | |

## Completed

_(Move initiatives here when done, or delete if no longer relevant)_

## When to Create an Initiative

Create an initiative when:
- Starting a multi-phase project (migration, refactor, new feature)
- Work spans multiple sessions or days
- You need to track progress and blockers

## Completing an Initiative

When an initiative completes:

1. Add a `## Retrospective` section with lessons learned
2. If significant, move to `../decisions/` as an ADR
3. Update this README's "Completed" table
4. Or simply delete if no longer valuable
